-- gh-5430: when MVCC was enabled for memtx, new replica registration attempt
-- could fail with 'duplicate error' in _cluster space. This was happening,
-- because _cluster is memtx. Changes to it were not visible for newer requests
-- until commit.
-- New replica ID was looked up in the space by its full scan. The scan used a
-- plain iterator and didn't see replicas, whose registration was in progress of
-- being written to WAL.
-- As a result, if 2 replicas came to register at the same time, they got the
-- same replica ID because didn't see each other in _cluster. One of them would
-- fail to register in the end due to the conflict.
--
-- The test reproduces it by doing anon replica registration. Because during
-- normal join there are more than one access to WAL, the ID assignment is the
-- last one. It makes hard to block the ID assignment only. With anon replica
-- ID assignment the join is already done, the only WAL write is the ID
-- assignment, easy to block and yet not block new replicas registration
-- attempts.
